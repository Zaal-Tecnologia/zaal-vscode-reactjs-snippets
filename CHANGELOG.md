## [2.0.0]

### Changed

As explained in the project [README](https://github.com/Zaal-Tecnologia/zaal-vscode-reactjs-snippets/blob/master/README.md), the idea of Zaal ReactJS Snippets is to create snippets that help us Zaal programmers and other programmers from around the world.

Therefore, we no longer use the concept of Ducks Pattern and Redux Sauce, we are using Redux Persist. As a result, the Ducks Pattern and Redux Sauce snippets were deprecated, and the new Redux Persist snippets were added.
